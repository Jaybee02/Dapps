## Getting Started
This project is to create 2-3 function of a smart contract connected to the frontend 

Thirdweb api's are used for creation of this progaram
run 'npx thirdweb create (the_name_of_your_program)

## Backend
The creation of backend works simultaneuosly with the UI/UX display of the frontend
inside src backend folder there is Contract.sol
- contract.sol contains the function written in code on how the program was been executed
- Open terminal and run 'npx thirdweb deploy'

## Frontend
In the frontend folder, there are series of files been worked on
- constants folder, there is a file name addresses.
- the addresses is connected to the api key created at the backend of the program for communication

Pages folder contains app.tsx and index. tsx.
These files contain all codes use in execution of the frontend program

And of course there is styles to beautify the ui/ux written in css

run 'yarn dev' in git bash to show the display of the program.
